# Content System

## Why this exists

The blog was missing two structural safeguards:

- no first-class source links in frontmatter
- no deterministic related-post rules

This system adds those pieces without breaking existing posts.

## Frontmatter

Use the fields below for new or updated posts.

```yaml

## Editorial rules

- Add at least one `sourceLinks` entry to any post that mentions rates, dates, filing deadlines, thresholds, or law changes.
- Use `lastChecked` on anything seasonal or law-change sensitive.
- Use `relatedSlugs` when there is a specific follow-up article that should outrank generic same-category posts.
- Use `keywords` for concept clusters, not for SEO stuffing.
## Authority priority

- For rates, deadlines, filing duties, thresholds, forms, penalties, and calculation formulas, cite the closest primary authority first.
- Preferred order: current law, current enforcement decree/rule/notice, official NTS/MOEF guidance, then case law or tribunal decisions.
- Do not attach a case just because it is about the same topic. The authority must directly support the sentence immediately before it.
- Use case law only when the point is interpretive: constitutionality, procedural illegality, judicial interpretation, substance-over-form, attribution, or similar dispute-driven issues.
- If a statutory citation already fully supports the point, do not add a decorative case citation after it.

## Rendering behavior

- post detail pages now expose dates, author, sources, and article JSON-LD
- related posts are ranked by `relatedSlugs`, then category, then keyword overlap

## Retrofit order

1. reform / deadline articles
2. evergreen tax guides with heavy traffic
3. archive or redirect overlapping summary posts
